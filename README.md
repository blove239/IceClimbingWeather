# Ice Climbing Weather Tool

The is v0.9 of the Ice climbing weather tool. The idea is to give ice climbers the ability to better assess ice conditions. By providing hourly weather data for the past 3 days. climbers should be able to more easily judge the conditions of the ice. Please note this is no replacement for actually visiting the climb and assessing the conditions for yourself. Ice climbing is a dangerous activity. Please advise caution, and check with local authorities before climbing.

Later versions will include a better UI and a simple algorithm to make predictions of local ice conditions.
