# Ice Climbing Weather Tool

A simple weather tool for that provides temperature conditions over the past several days. It is designed to help ice climbers make predictions on local ice conditions. Inspired by the [Petzl Waterfall Ice Study](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Waterfall-ice-study?ActivityName=Ice-climbing)

Please note this is no replacement for actually visiting the climb and assessing the conditions for yourself. Ice climbing is a dangerous activity. Please advise caution, and check with local authorities before climbing.
